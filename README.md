Turn based strategy board game for 4 people. A clone of the popular board game.

To start: Enter your and your friends' names and click Start.

Click on a block to pick it up. Mouse wheel or  press Q E to rotate a block.
Middle click or press Space to turn it ot other side.
Click again to place on a board.

First turn must be made in the corner. Latter, newly placed block must touch at least one corner of any your previous blocks. 
But it must not touch borders of your blocks.

The one who scores most points wins.

I'm currently (at the exact moment unless I'm sleeping) working on web based multiplayer.
